Shirley Magazine has published my short story [_Sonya_](https://www.shirleymag.com/#block-c19a90456738da6b06b0)!

I adore Shirley Jackson's _The Lottery_, so it's lovely to be in a magazine named after her. _Sonya_ is one my favorites of things I've written, so I'm also glad that I found a cool home for it. This makes nine stories published this year, more to come!
