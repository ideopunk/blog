When it got bad, he hid inside the moon. There he decided to always tell the truth. Soon after that, they took his brother away. 

As he grew up, he became very worried that if he lied, nobody would know. He decided to stop talking, just in case.

In his dreams he did things he could never imagine and it scared him. 

One day, years later, his therapist suggested keeping a journal. She stifled a reaction when he started to shake and cry. 

"I don't think that would be a good idea," he said, croaking. "I don't think that would be a good idea at all."
