[The Metaworker](https://www.themetaworker.com/) has published three of my tiny stories [here](https://www.themetaworker.com/2022/08/15/three-microfictions-by-conor-barnes/)!

This makes eight stories published this year, with five more on the way this Autumn. I've made a tool in Go ([Ciere](https://github.com/ideopunk/ciere)) to help with assembling submissions and it's helping plenty. 

Enjoy!
