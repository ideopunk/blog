[The Chamber Magazine](https://thechambermagazine.com) has graciously published three stories of mine: _The Duel_, _The Dream Eater_, and _Void_ [here](https://thechambermagazine.com/2022/10/07/three-works-of-flash-fiction-by-conor-barnes-the-dream-eater-the-duel-and-void/). There's a neat time jump here, in that _The Duel_ was written the first week of January, when I started this challenge, and the other two were written at the end of August.
