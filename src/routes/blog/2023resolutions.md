Every year I take on some big projects. I think resolutions are “serious” and it should matter if you don’t follow through. I didn’t follow through on half of my resolutions last year, so this year I’m going to be much more focused and cut it down to two. 

**135 pounds**

I am going to work out regularly, gain 10 pounds, and thereby hit 135 pounds (80% probability)! This is one I did not succeed at last year, but after conversations with friends and thinking about it more, the benefits are too huge to ignore:

- I have a sedentary job and I feel myself getting tired out more easily than I suspect a 29-year old should. 
- It seems like exercise minutes pay off at 3x extended life minutes. 
- I’ve become more anxious over the last year and recall being less anxious when I last took working out seriously. 
- I _like_ being strong. 

These are too good! Especially because I can think through my next resolution while doing it!

Many of the benefits could be gained through cardio, but 1) my friend [Robert](https://twitter.com/iskanderlee) points out that it’s easier to interact with Things in the world when one is stronger, and 2) I find running really boring ha ha. 

**Interlinked Short Story Collection**

I am going to write a short story collection that adds up to a novel (90% probability). My favourite read this last year might have been [People From My Neighborhood](https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/676239/people-from-my-neighborhood-by-hiromi-kawakami/), and I adored how it did interconnected short stories. I’m still very happy working on short stories, but I want to do a big project. Shout outs to my pal [Hannah](https://twitter.com/hannahtstoll) for the inspiration. And then I am going to try to get it published. Whether that works out is beyond my control so that isn’t a commitment, but I think my writing is at a level where I have a shot!

**So!**

I hope that you ('dear reader'?) have a lovely 2023. I hope that your 2022 was better than the preceeding years and that 2023 is even better. I hope that you succeed with your own goals and become happier and more at peace. If we ever cross paths, let me know how your own quests are going!
