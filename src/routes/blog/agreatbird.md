I've been converting this blog over to Svelte over the last month. In the process, I forgot to mention a publication! I've had another story out, this time by Literally Stories. If you scroll down [here](https://literallystories2014.com/2022/07/09/week-384-born-too-late-five-timely-tales-and-a-saturday-special-not-written-by-tom/) you'll find it at the bottom. Enjoy!

This makes five stories published. Five more are slated to come out in the autumn. I currently have 68 written out of the eventual 100. I am more than on track to hit that number. It would be exciting to have 20 published by the end of the year, but I'd be more than pleased if I only hit 10.
