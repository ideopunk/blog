You can see the form at the bottom. It was inevitable -- I'm off to [Substack](https://parhelia.substack.com/)!

Here's why:
1. My least favourite part of having a blog is worrying about email delivery. Leaving it to another service would be real nice.
2. It seems likely that it will be easier to gain readers through it.

I'm not sure if I'll cross-post, or how I'll handle having 'two' blogs. There's still plenty to be determined, actually. However, I've decided that jumping in is the fastest way to resolve remaining questions. And I do know that I'll be posting fiction more regularly than I posted it here. Do subscribe, I hope you enjoy!
