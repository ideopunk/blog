My Million-Dollar Decision

I made a bet on rationality. 

My girlfriend proposed it. 

What's the rationalist thing to do? Make a spreadsheet with fake numbers, of course!

**Before**

I didn’t go to university after high school. Instead, I became an anarchist semi-cultist. Even after leaving that world, I couldn’t think of what I’d want to go to school for. I avoided going into debt for a degree without career prospects, but I should have put more effort into figuring out what I wanted to do for the next 45 years. 

Eventually I decided to become a library technician. Most of the workers you see at libraries are library technicians, not librarians. We handle things like acquisitions, cataloguing, processing, patron interactions, and lower-level reference work, whereas librarians have more admin roles and do things like teach classes, reference and research work, and policy and purchase decision-making. 

Why did I go for the library tech program? It’s simple: It would take two years to become a library tech (diploma) and at least five years to become a librarian (undergrad and masters). I was tired of minimum wage work and wanted out asap. 

That was short-term thinking, but it's hard for me to be mad at myself in retrospect. I learned a lot from my year and a half as a library tech

Being a library tech was great and I’ll 


**The Sheet**

I decided to compare some counterfactuals.

- What if I stay a library tech?
- What if I take some courses to bolster my current position -- something like 'records management' courses?
- What if I became a librarian?
- What if I became a programmer?

I started by comparing income. Column E is illustrative, though I think the math is suspicious (it doesn't account for gains from savings, for one thing). There's a 700 000 difference between being a librarian and a programmer. There's a 1mil difference between being a library tech and a programmer! That was pretty eye-opening. An alternative title 

footnote:
This is all simplified, of course -- as a programmer I could (have) start(ed) at lower than 80,000, and I'd probably end my career making more than that, and as a librarian I could become a head librarian at some point. But it's a start.

There's more to a job than money though. So I added in other things I care about: remote work, use of skills, job security, fun, altruism, fit, good colleagues, benefits. I then tried to evaluate how important these were compared to income on the margin. For example: How much of my income would I trade for remote work? If I had a choice, how much more would I need to be paid to work in-person? I figured that I would trade 25% of my income for remote work (in retrospect, a lot of this has to do with commute time). I'd be equally enticed by an in-person job at 75 000 and a remote job at 100 000. Remember, that's not how I'd rank it now, but it was useful to have a made-up number at the time. 

This also helped a lot with evaluating what I find important. I love having great co-workers. But how important is it relative to pay? What would I trade? Creating the sheet helped a lot with deciding what I actually value and what I actually want. It's very easy to think "good enough" instead of "but is it optimal?" and by writing it out, I helped myself see that my current situation wasn't optimal. 

In some ways this doesn't work -- it's not clear what happens at 0 Pay, or 0 Security, or 0 Colleagues. But when most values are mostly near the top, the model works. 

And so on for remaining values. Looking back, some of the values are funny. For example, Records Management should have a strictly better risk score (I3) than Library Technician, it's the same job but with more skills! Colleagues is sort of a made up column: I couldn't know how fun my future colleagues would be, I just knew that I really liked my library colleagues. Altruism has a low importance rating (K9, K10) because I foresaw a lot of my impact coming from my [giving](https://www.givingwhatwecan.org/), so Altruism refers to any additional impact on top of that determined by income. 

I then combined these scores into various evaluations. A standard score based on adding category scores divided by importance. Scores as percentage and scores as grades. Scores relative to the highest scoring career. Scores on a 1-5 scale. The point of expressing these in each ways was to give another way of looking at them -- ex. A 55% is a D, why are you working at a job you'd give a D? 





Remember, if it's worth doing, it's worth doing with made up numbers.
