This year was better than the last, woooo!

**Joys**

I had a very fortunate year. 

I saw Dune live with my best friends. It gave me goosebumps for weeks afterwards.

I watched Smash Summit 11 with my friend [Dylan](https://twitter.com/RomeoNOubliette). We ate Korean food and it was perfectly happy.

I went to Portugal and met my team! I also finally met my friend [Xiq](https://twitter.com/ExGenesis) there, complete with basil ice cream. 

**Resolutions**

Failures

- I didn't become the best smasher in Nova Scotia. I reached [#5](https://twitter.com/FrogFromNS/status/1390416551657054222?s=20)! However, in April I realized that if I was going to seriously try becoming the best, I'd have to abandon all other goals (and probably watch my wrists disintegrate). So there was at least a strategic retreat!

- I didn't release music. This was tricky because it relied on coordination between people. I also found a lot of barriers between "mood to work on this instead of something else" and "actually recording music". This is probably solvable, but not a priority for 2022.

**Accomplishments**

- I got a job! I've been working at [Melange](https://www.melange.io/) as a front-end dev for almost a year. It's been crazy, it's been fun, it's been crazy. Funnily enough, this came about because [Glenn Yu](https://twitter.com/@congladiator) saw my wrap-up post from last year, in which I mentioned job-hunting. [Blogging is networking for introverts](https://github.com/ideopunk/tonal-distancing)!

- I wrote a novella! After a summer of writing and a fall of editing, I still don't know if it's good. I do know that I like it. If you're in the mood for a 100-page time-loop romance with an effective altruist who Goes Too Far, message me! If you have any knowledge about publishing or *promotion*, let me know, the idea of people reading it makes me happy!

- I learned how to code in Rust. There's something I like about it aesthetically, the speed and the safety. It's been a big challenge, but I'm going to keep coding in it. It requires a different mindset from what I'm used to in TypeScript (and, of course, I'm noticing it make me a better coder overall). I ended the year by making a [server/cli](https://github.com/ideopunk/tonal-distancing) combo out of a feature I wanted while writing my novella. There isn't yet a front-end for it, but I count the Rust portion as complete! 

- This wasn't in my resolutions, but I finally got my license. Steve Reich has become my highway soundtrack.
