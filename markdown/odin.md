A year ago, I had zero programming experience. For the last month I’ve been working at  Melange as a front-end engineer working in React Native. How did I get here? 

**Route**

Once I settled on learning to code (more on that in a later post), I first took CS50x, Harvard’s introduction to computer science. It was great and I happily recommend it to anybody. The first lecture is a pleasure to watch even if you don’t intend to participate. 

After that, I began the Odin Project (more on that choice below). It took me about eight months to finish. I did the Node route and didn’t do the final Node project. I went part-time at my job as a library cataloguer and was able to reserve 20 hours a week for learning. It went like this:

Work Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesday mornings. 
Code Wednesday afternoons, Thursdays, and Fridays.

However, I spent a massive chunk of my ‘free’ time coding (or reading documentation, tutorials, etc.). Super roughly, I’d say I spent 35-40 hours a week on the whole venture. That was from May to November. In November, I quit my job and moved across the country with my girlfriend (who bought a house!). I started working on TOP full-time (maybe bump the hours up to 50?). You can see this in my GitHub contributions, ha ha.

So, I was extremely lucky to have a lot of time to work on TOP and to have the savings to support it. I think somebody working full-time without dependents to support could complete it in a year, very roughly.



**Why Odin?**

There are more or less three routes* for learning to code: 

1. Get a CS degree
2. Attend a bootcamp
3. Teach yourself

The problem with #1 is that it takes four years and a chunk of money. I decided to learn to code at 26. I did not want to finish at 30. 

I briefly considered #2, but friends discouraged it. I'm glad they did. Lambda School's model is great and far superior to the traditional university model, but the bootcamp industry seems like a shitshow. 

So I settled on #3. But even with that, there are a lot of potential routes. FCC, Udemy courses, Codeacademy. I also tried to keep in mind  the problem of autodidacticism: The likelihood that small gaps in knowledge will creep in without the learner knowing. When you don’t know what you don’t know, it’s pretty hard to guess at what you need to know! So: I wanted a curriculum. 

Somehow, I found Odin

**What didn’t work**

Were there gaps in TOP? Not really. I think it could benefit from a lesson on serverless functions (especially because it recommends using Firebase on one or two projects), but overall it was incredibly thorough. 

The HTML/CSS track is recommended to be done after the Javascript track, but I really think that’s a bad way to go about things. I went on the Javascript track, and found that I was fighting both CSS and Javascript on each project (and had no idea how to make the sites mobile-friendly). I stopped the Javascript track, switched over to CSS, and was able to get back to Javascript with much less to worry about. 

The *Testing JavaScript* section could have benefited from resources on testing React.

Using modules and factories in the Tic Tac Toe project was a bit much for me to wrap my head around at the time.

happily recommend it. 

When would I not recommend it? 
- You’re bad at managing your own time, whether due to organization or discipline issues. Still, I’d recommend starting, and if you find it isn’t working for you, switch to something more structured. 
- You have the money, time, and desire for a full CS degree. TOP is a web development curriculum. If you feel stoked about CS, go for CS. 

Other reasons to not do TOP apply to not learning programming in general: Becoming frustrated easily, lacking curiosity.

It feels really good to put things out into the world! I got to send people websites I deployed on GitHub Pages (and eventually, Firebase and Netlify). 

builds some habits. There isn’t handholding, so if you want to finish you have to get good at looking things up for yourself and experimenting. 

Challenge 
The support isn’t what you’d have with a formal teacher. If you’re stuck and don’t even have the mental framework to know where you’d start googling, that’s when a knowledgeable teacher would be useful. 


I wanted something comprehensive and something that would lead to me building a portfolio and putting my own work into the world. Alternatives like freeCodeCamp didn’t seem to involve actually setting up an IDE, using the command line, or deploying projects, and I’d read multiple accounts of how they didn’t feel prepared until they did TOP. 


I’m now working for WeFlop as their front-end developer, creating an app in React Native. I don’t want to spoil more than that, but soon enough we’ll have something exciting to share. 

Much thanks need to be given to my library and supervisor for supporting me going part-time (it’d be pretty reasonable for them to not!), to my girlfriend for encouraging me to take the job. 

* Community college is also an option, but I haven't heard much about it as an option so I can't speak to it. Sorry!
